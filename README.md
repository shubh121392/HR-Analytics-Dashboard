# Title: HR-Analytics-Dashboard

# Objective:
To analyze HR data and build a dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee attrition. The dashboard will offer insights into attrition trends by department, job role, age group, job satisfaction, and other factors.

# Tools Used:
MS Excel- Data Collection and export of CSV as DB
MS PowerBI- for visualization and creating a dashboard

# Summary:
The HR dataset consists of multiple columns, including employee details (age, department, years at the company), job satisfaction, and whether the employee has left the company (attrition). By calculating an "Attrition Count" column, we can visualize total employees, total attrition, and attrition rates. The data also includes variables like age, salary, education, and years in the current role, allowing for analysis across different demographic and job-related factors.

# Key Insights:
1. Departmental Attrition: Certain departments may have higher attrition rates, especially in roles requiring extensive travel.
2. Age and Experience: Younger employees or those with fewer years at the company may exhibit higher attrition.
3. Job Satisfaction: Low job satisfaction appears to correlate with higher attrition, especially within specific job roles.
4. Salary and Attrition: Employees in lower salary brackets may be more likely to leave, highlighting compensation as a potential retention factor.

# Conclusion:
This HR dataset provides a solid foundation for understanding employee attrition and its influencing factors, enabling targeted interventions for retention
